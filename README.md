It is a simple, interactive web application that allows users to input a set of five numbers and sort them in ascending order. This project demonstrates the implementation of multiple sorting algorithms including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort. The application uses a clean, responsive design and provides immediate feedback to the user by displaying the sorted array.
